# Lab 8: Recursive Functions in Linked Lists

**Name:** Chlo√© Morali  
**Class:** COEN 11 - Advanced Programming Winter 2021  

## Objective
Add recursive functions to the linked list system for traversing and manipulating the list, including printing and deleting elements recursively.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C
- **Environment:** Unix/Linux command line

## Instructions
- Implement functions to print the linked list in reverse order using recursion.
- Add recursive functions to delete all elements from the list.
- Ensure that the recursive functions handle all edge cases and base conditions correctly.

### Example Usage
```bash
$ gcc -o lab8 lab8.c
$ ./lab8 data.txt
